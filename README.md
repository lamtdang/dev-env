# My personal development environment

---


## Background

Even though having been a SWE for quite some time, everytime I work with a new machine, I have to spend quite some time to set up new environment, new tooling, which takes a lot of time. As I grow, I figure it would be best to have my development environment **portable**, **custom** and ready to be migrated to system that I work on. I also recognized the power of dotfiles and configuration files as they allows me to ship all my configuration to Git for easy access and migration to new machine/environment. Therefore, I set forth to research, tinker and develop the tools that fit best for my development, and more importantly **SHIPPABLE** via config files.

## GOAL

- Easy to ship/setup
- Highly customizable which leads to faster development
- Learn more about tools/system that I use (OS, Vim, Terminal)
- Keyboard-oriented: Allow me to write software faster and look cool doing  


## DEVELOPMENT COMPONENT

- [ ] OS: NixOS
- [ ] Terminal: Alacritty
- [ ] TextEditor: Nvim (Lazy Vim)
- [ ] Tiling Window: ?
